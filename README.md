## 🗂️ Database Schema Overview

### Entities

**👤 Users**  
`id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role (host/guest)`

**🏡 Properties**  
`id`, `owner_id`, `title`, `description`, `location`

**📅 Bookings**  
`id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`

**⭐ Reviews**  
`id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`

**💳 Payments**  
`id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_status`, `payment_date`

### Relationships

- One User can be both host and guest  
- A Property belongs to one User but has many Bookings and Reviews  
- Each Booking links a User and a Property, and can have one Payment
